# Day 3: Variables & Data Types

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Video:** Programming with Mosh - Variables (30 min)
**Feeling:** 😊 Excited to learn!

---

## 🎯 Today's Goal
Understand what variables are and how to use different data types

---

## 📺 Video Watched
"C# Variables Explained" by Mosh
Link: [youtube.com/...]
Duration: 30 minutes

**Watched:** ✅ Full video
**Coded Along:** ✅ All examples
**Built Project:** ✅ Age calculator

---

## 📝 Key Points

- Variables = boxes that store data
- Every variable has a TYPE (int, string, etc.)
- Must DECLARE before using
- Use meaningful names (age, not x)
- C# is case-sensitive!

---

## 💡 New Concepts

### Concept 1: Variable Declaration

**What it is:**
Telling C# "I need a box to store data"

**Syntax:**
```csharp
int age;  // Declare
age = 16; // Assign value
```

**Or combined:**
```csharp
int age = 16;
```

**Why it matters:**
Can't use variable without declaring it first!

---

### Concept 2: Data Types

**int** → Whole numbers
```csharp
int age = 16;
int score = 100;
```

**string** → Text
```csharp
string name = "Sylvester";
string city = "Hamburg";
```

**double** → Decimal numbers
```csharp
double price = 19.99;
double temperature = 36.5;
```

**bool** → True/False
```csharp
bool isStudent = true;
bool isRaining = false;
```

---

### Concept 3: Naming Rules

**Good names:**
✅ age (clear!)
✅ userName (describes what it holds)
✅ totalPrice (meaningful)

**Bad names:**
❌ x (what is x??)
❌ temp (too vague)
❌ asdfgh (meaningless!)

**Rules:**
- Start with letter or underscore
- Can't use spaces (use camelCase)
- Can't be C# keywords (int, string, etc.)

---

## 💻 Code I Wrote

### Example 1: Basic Variables
```csharp
using System;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        // My first variables!
        string name = "Sylvester";
        int age = 16;
        string city = "Hamburg";
        bool isLearning = true;
        
        Console.WriteLine("Name: " + name);
        Console.WriteLine("Age: " + age);
        Console.WriteLine("City: " + city);
        Console.WriteLine("Learning C#: " + isLearning);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Name: Sylvester
Age: 16
City: Hamburg
Learning C#: True
```

**What I learned:**
- Can mix different data types
- + operator combines strings
- bool prints as True/False

---

### Example 2: Age Calculator (MY OWN PROJECT!)
```csharp
using System;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine("=== Age Calculator ===");
        
        Console.Write("Enter your birth year: ");
        string input = Console.ReadLine();
        int birthYear = int.Parse(input);
        
        int currentYear = 2025;
        int age = currentYear - birthYear;
        
        Console.WriteLine("You are " + age + " years old!");
        
        if (age >= 18) {
            Console.WriteLine("You're an adult!");
        } else {
            Console.WriteLine("You're a minor!");
        }
    }
}
```

**What's special:**
- Used int.Parse() to convert string to int (NEW!)
- Did math with variables (2025 - birthYear)
- Added if/else for bonus feature
- **I figured this out myself!** 🎉

## ❓ Questions & Confusions

**Resolved:**
✅ Why do we need types? → So C# knows how to handle the data!
✅ What's int.Parse()? → Converts string to integer

**Still wondering:**
❓ What happens if user enters text instead of number in my calculator?
   → Will research "exception handling" later
❓ Are there other data types? 
   → Mosh mentioned float, decimal - will learn tomorrow

## 🔥 Aha Moment!

**VARIABLES ARE JUST LABELED STORAGE BOXES!**

Before: "Variables are confusing technical things"
Now: "Oh! It's just like labeling boxes in my room!"
```
[Box labeled "age"]    → Contains: 16
[Box labeled "name"]   → Contains: "Sylvester"
[Box labeled "city"]   → Contains: "Hamburg"
```

This clicked SO hard! Now I get it! 💡

## 🤔 Reflection

**What I understood well:**
- How to declare variables ✅
- Different data types (int, string, bool, double) ✅
- Why naming matters ✅
- How to use variables in Console.WriteLine ✅

**What was challenging:**
- Remembering which type for which data (got easier with practice)
- int.Parse() syntax (but I got it after trying!)
- Knowing when to use double vs int (still a bit unsure)

**How I feel right now:**
😊 CONFIDENT! I can actually code things now!
Not just "Hello World" - real programs that DO something!

**What surprised me:**
How much you can do with just variables! My age calculator feels like a REAL program!

---

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Plan

**Topics to cover:**
- More about data types (float, decimal, char)
- Type conversion (double to int, etc.)
- Constants (variables that don't change)

**Video to watch:**
- Mosh's next section on operators (30 min)

**Project to build:**
- Temperature converter (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)
- Uses double, math operations, and user input

**Goal:**
Understand ALL basic data types by end of tomorrow!

## 🎉 Win of the Day

**I BUILT AN AGE CALCULATOR FROM SCRATCH!**

Mosh didn't show this - I created it myself using what I learned!
It works! It does math! It makes decisions (if/else)!

This feels AMAZING! I'm actually programming! 🚀

---

## **SEE THE DIFFERENCE?**

**Just watching:**
- "Yeah, I get it" (but do you really?)
- Forget in 2 days
- Boring after 20 min

**Watch + Notes + Code + Build:**
- Deep understanding ✅
- Won't forget ✅
- Engaged the whole time ✅
- PROUD of what you built ✅

---

## **ANTI-BOREDOM STRATEGIES:**

### **1. Pomodoro Technique**
- 25 min focused work
- 5 min break (walk, stretch, snack)
- Repeat 3-4 times
- Longer break (15-30 min)

**Why it works:** Brain stays fresh!

---

### **2. Gamify Your Learning**

**Create challenges:**
- "Can I build this without looking?"
- "Can I add 3 features he didn't show?"
- "Can I explain this to my imaginary student?"

**Track streaks:**
- Days in a row coding
- GitHub green squares
- Projects completed

---

### **3. Change Scenery**

**Don't always code in same spot:**
- Coffee shop
- Library
- Park (laptop + hotspot)
- Different room

**Fresh environment = fresh mindset!**

---

### **4. Build Things YOU Care About**

**Don't just follow tutorials blindly.**

**Make it personal:**
- Calculator → Budget tracker for YOUR money
- Name program → Your favorite games list
- Todo app → Homework tracker

**When it's YOURS, it's not boring!**

---

### **5. Share Your Progress**

**Post on LinkedIn:**
"Day 3: Built my first age calculator in C#! 🎉"
[Screenshot of code]

**Why:**
- Feels real
- People encourage you
- Cargonerds sees your dedication
- Accountability
